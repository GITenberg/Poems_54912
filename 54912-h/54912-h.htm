<h3>MAUD AND MADGE</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Maud in a crimson velvet chair</span>
<span class="i2">Strings her pearls on a silken thread,</span>
<span class="i0">While, lovingly lifting her golden hair,</span>
<span class="i2">Soft airs wander about her head.</span>
<span class="i0">She has silken robes of the softest flow,</span>
<span class="i2">She has jewels rare and a chain of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And her two white hands flit to and fro,</span>
<span class="i2">Fair as the dainty toys they hold.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She has tropical birds and rare perfumes;</span>
<span class="i2">Pictures that speak to the heart and eye;</span>
<span class="i0">For her each flower of the Orient blooms,—</span>
<span class="i2">For her the song and the lute swell high;</span>
<span class="i0">But daintily stringing her gleaming pearls</span>
<span class="i2">She dreams to-day in her velvet chair,</span>
<span class="i0">While the sunlight sleeps in her golden curls,</span>
<span class="i2">Lightly stirred by the odorous air.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down on the beach, when the tide goes out,</span>
<span class="i2">Madge is gathering shining shells;</span>
<span class="i0">The sea-breeze blows her locks about;</span>
<span class="i2">O’er bare, brown feet the white sand swells.</span>
<span class="i0">Coarsest serge is her gown of gray,</span>
<span class="i2">Faded and torn her apron blue,</span>
<span class="i0">And there in the beautiful, dying day</span>
<span class="i2">The girl still thinks of the work to do.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stains of labor are on her hands,</span>
<span class="i2">Lost is the young form’s airy grace;</span>
<span class="i0">And standing there on the shining sands</span>
<span class="i2">You read her fate in her weary face.</span>
<span class="i0">Up with the dawn to toil all day</span>
<span class="i2">For meagre fare and a place to sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">Seldom a moment to dream or play,</span>
<span class="i2">Little leisure to laugh or weep.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beautiful Maud, you think, maybe,</span>
<span class="i2">Lying back in your velvet chair,</span>
<span class="i0">There is naught in common with her and thee,—</span>
<span class="i2">You scarce could breathe in the self-same air.</span>
<span class="i0">But the warm blood in her girlish heart</span>
<span class="i2">Leaps quick as yours at her nature’s call,</span>
<span class="i0">And ye, though moving so far apart,</span>
<span class="i2">Must share one destiny after all.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love shall come to you both one day,</span>
<span class="i2">For still must be what aye hath been;</span>
<span class="i0">And under satin or russet gray</span>
<span class="i2">Hearts will open to let him in.</span>
<span class="i0">Motherhood with its joy and woe</span>
<span class="i2">Each must compass through burning pain,—</span>
<span class="i0">You, fair Maud, with your brow of snow,</span>
<span class="i2">Madge with her brown hands labor-stained.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each shall sorrow and each shall weep,</span>
<span class="i2">Though one is in hovel, one in hall;</span>
<span class="i0">Over your gold the frost shall creep,</span>
<span class="i2">As over her jet the snows will fall.</span>
<span class="i0">Exquisite Maud, you lift your eyes</span>
<span class="i2">At Madge out yonder under the sun;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet know ye both by the countless ties</span>
<span class="i2">Of a common womanhood ye are one!</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the dark valley, where the shadows dim</span>

<h3>OVER THE WALL</h3>

<span class="i0">I know a spot where the wild vines creep,</span>
<span class="i2">And the coral moss-cups grow,</span>
<span class="i0">And where, at the foot of the rocky steep,</span>
<span class="i2">The sweet blue violets blow.</span>
<span class="i0">There all day long, in the summer-time,</span>
<span class="i0">You may hear the river’s dreamy rhyme;</span>
<span class="i0">There all day long does the honey-bee</span>
<span class="i0">Murmur and hum in the hollow tree.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there the feathery hemlock makes</span>
<span class="i2">A shadow cool and sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">While from its emerald wing it shakes</span>
<span class="i2">Rare incense at your feet.</span>
<span class="i0">There do the silvery lichens cling,</span>
<span class="i0">There does the tremulous harebell swing;</span>
<span class="i0">And many a scarlet berry shines</span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the green of the tangled vines.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Over the wall at dawn of day,</span>
<span class="i2">Over the wall at noon,</span>
<span class="i0">Over the wall when the shadows say</span>
<span class="i2">That night is coming soon,</span>
<span class="i0">A little maiden with laughing eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Climbs in her eager haste, and hies</span>
<span class="i0">Down to the spot where the wild vines creep,</span>
<span class="i0">And violets bloom by the rocky steep.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All wild things love her. The murmuring bee</span>
<span class="i2">Scarce stirs when she draws near,</span>
<span class="i0">And sings the bird in the hemlock-tree</span>
<span class="i2">Its sweetest for her ear.</span>
<span class="i0">The harebells nod as she passes by,</span>
<span class="i0">The violet lifts its tender eye,</span>
<span class="i0">The low ferns bend her steps to greet,</span>
<span class="i0">And the mosses creep to her dancing feet.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up in her pathway seems to spring</span>
<span class="i2">All that is sweet or rare,—</span>
<span class="i0">Chrysalis quaint, or the moth’s bright wing,</span>
<span class="i2">Or flower-buds strangely fair.</span>
<span class="i0">She watches the tiniest bird’s-nest hid</span>
<span class="i0">The thickly clustering leaves amid;</span>
<span class="i0">And the small brown tree-toad on her arm</span>
<span class="i0">Quietly hops, and fears no harm.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, child of the laughing eyes, and heart</span>
<span class="i2">Attuned to Nature’s voice!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast found a bliss that will ne’er depart</span>
<span class="i2">While earth can say, “Rejoice!”</span>
<span class="i0">The years must come, and the years must go;</span>
<span class="i0">But the flowers will bloom, and the breezes blow,</span>

<span class="i0">Bring on their swift wings joy to thee!</span>

<h3>OUTGROWN</h3>

<span class="i0">Nay, you wrong her, my friend, she’s not fickle; her love she has simply outgrown;</span>
<span class="i0">One can read the whole matter, translating her heart by the light of one’s own.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Can you bear me to talk with you frankly? There is much that my heart would say,</span>

<span class="i0">As plainly, perhaps, and as bluntly, as I might in our earlier youth.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Five summers ago, when you wooed her, you stood on the self-same plane,</span>
<span class="i0">Face to face, heart to heart, never dreaming your souls could be parted again.</span>

<span class="i0">She loved you at that time entirely, in the bloom of her life’s early May,</span>
<span class="i0">And it is not her fault, I repeat it, that she does not love you to-day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nature never stands still, nor souls either. They ever go up or go down;</span>
<span class="i0">And hers has been steadily soaring,—but how has it been with your own?</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She has struggled, and yearned, and aspired,—grown stronger and wiser each year;</span>
<span class="i0">The stars are not farther above you, in yon luminous atmosphere!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For she whom you crowned with fresh roses, down yonder, five summers ago,</span>

<h3>VASHTI’S SCROLL</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dethroned and crownless, I so late a queen!</span>
<span class="i0">Forsaken, poor and lonely, I who wore</span>
<span class="i0">The crown of Persia with such stately grace!</span>
<span class="i0">But yesterday a royal wife; but now</span>
<span class="i0">From my estate cast down, and fallen so low</span>
<span class="i0">That beggars scoff at me! Men toss my name</span>
<span class="i0">Backward and forward on their mocking tongues.</span>
<span class="i0">In all the king’s broad realm there is not one</span>
<span class="i0">To do poor Vashti homage. Even the dog</span>
<span class="i0">My hand had fondled, in the palace walls</span>
<span class="i0">Fawns on my rival. When I left the court,</span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and sore distressed, he followed me,</span>
<span class="i0">Licking my fingers, leaping in my face,</span>
<span class="i0">And frisking round me till I reached the gates.</span>
<span class="i0">Then with long pauses, as of one perplexed,</span>
<span class="i0">And frequent lookings backward, and low whines</span>
<span class="i0">Of puzzled wonder—that had made me smile</span>
<span class="i0">If I had been less lorn—with drooping ears,</span>
<span class="i0">Dropt eyes, and downcast forehead he went back,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaving me desolate. So went they all</span>
<span class="i0">Who, when Ahasuerus on my brow</span>
<span class="i0">Set his own royal crown and called me queen,</span>
<span class="i0">Made the air ring with plaudits! Loud they cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Long live Queen Vashti, Persia’s fairest Rose,</span>
<span class="i0">Mother of Princes, and the nation’s Hope!”</span>
<span class="i0">The rose is withered now; the queen’s no more.</span>
<span class="i0">To these lorn breasts no princely boy shall cling</span>
<span class="i0">Or now, or ever. Yet on this poor scroll</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I will rehearse the story of my woes,</span>
<span class="i0">And bid them lay it in the grave with me</span>
<span class="i0">When I depart to join the unnumbered dead.</span>

<span class="i0">Shalt bear it outward to the sun and air:</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, thou whose patient fingers shall unroll</span>
<span class="i0">With slow, persuasive touch this little scroll:</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, loving, tender eyes that, like twin stars,</span>
<span class="i0">I seem to see through yonder cloudy bars:</span>

<span class="i0">Ahasuerus reigned. On Persia’s throne,</span>
<span class="i0">Lord of a mighty realm, he sat alone,</span>
<span class="i0">And stretched his sceptre from the farthest slope</span>
<span class="i0">Of India’s hills, to where the Ethiop</span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt in barbaric splendor. Kinglier king</span>
<span class="i0">Never did poet praise or minstrel sing!</span>
<span class="i0">He had no peers. Among his lords he shone</span>
<span class="i0">As shines a planet, single and alone;</span>
<span class="i0">And I, alas! I loved him, and we two</span>
<span class="i0">Such bliss as peasant lovers joy in, knew!</span>
<span class="i0">No lowly home in all our wide domain</span>
<span class="i0">Held more of peace than ours, or less of pain.</span>
<span class="i0">But one dark day—O, woeful day of days,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose hours I number now in sad amaze,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst no prophet of the ills to be,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor sign nor omen came to succor me!—</span>
<span class="i0">That day Ahasuerus smiled and said,</span>
<span class="i0">“Since first I wore this crown upon my head</span>
<span class="i0">Thrice have the emerald clusters of the vine</span>
<span class="i0">Changed to translucent globes of ruby wine;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice the peaches on the loaded walls</span>
<span class="i0">Have slowly rounded into wondrous balls</span>
<span class="i0">Of gold and crimson. I will make a feast.</span>
<span class="i0">Princes and lords, the greatest and the least,</span>
<span class="i0">All Persia and all Media, shall see</span>
<span class="i0">The pomp and splendor that encompass me.</span>
<span class="i0">The riches of my kingdom shall be shown,</span>
<span class="i0">And all my glorious majesty made known</span>
<span class="i0">Where’er the shadow of my sceptred hand</span>
<span class="i0">Sways a great people with its mute command!”</span>
<span class="i0">Then came from far and near a hurrying throng</span>
<span class="i0">Of skilled and cunning workmen. All day long</span>
<span class="i0">And far into the startled night, they wrought</span>
<span class="i0">Most quaint and beautiful devices—still</span>
<span class="i0">Responsive to their master’s eager will,</span>
<span class="i0">And giving form to his creative thought—</span>
<span class="i0">Till Shushan grew a marvel!</span>
<span class="i22">Never yet</span>
<span class="i0">Yon rolling sun on fairer scene has set:</span>
<span class="i0">The palace windows were ablaze with light;</span>
<span class="i0">And Persia’s lords were there, most richly dight</span>
<span class="i0">In broidered silks, or costliest cloth of gold,</span>
<span class="i0">That kept the sunshine in each lustrous fold,</span>
<span class="i0">Or softly flowing tissues, pure and white</span>
<span class="i0">As fleecy clouds at noonday. Clear and bright</span>
<span class="i0">Shone the pure gold of Ophir, and the gleam</span>
<span class="i0">Of burning gems, that mocked the pallid beam</span>
<span class="i0">Of the dim, wondering stars, made radiance there,</span>
<span class="i0">Splendor undreamed of, and beyond compare!</span>
<span class="i0">Up from the gardens floated the perfume</span>
<span class="i0">Of rose and myrtle, in their perfect bloom;</span>
<span class="i0">The red pomegranate cleft its heart in twain,</span>
<span class="i0">Pouring its life blood in a crimson rain;</span>
<span class="i0">The slight acacia waved its yellow plumes,</span>
<span class="i0">And afar off amid the starlit glooms</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Were sweet recesses, where the orange bowers</span>
<span class="i0">Dropt their pure blossoms down in snowy showers,</span>
<span class="i0">And night reigned undisturbed.</span>
<span class="i20">From cups of gold</span>
<span class="i0">Diverse one from another, meet to hold</span>
<span class="i0">The king’s most costly wines, or to be raised</span>
<span class="i0">To princely lips, the gay guests drank, and praised</span>
<span class="i0">Their rich abundance. Rapturous music swept</span>
<span class="i0">Through the vast arches and the secret kept</span>
<span class="i0">Of its own joy; while in slow, rhythmic time</span>
<span class="i0">To clash of cymbal and the lute’s clear chime,</span>
<span class="i0">The dancing-girls stole through the fragrant night</span>
<span class="i0">With wreathéd arms, flushed cheeks and eyes alight,</span>
<span class="i0">And softly rounded forms that rose and fell</span>
<span class="i0">To the voluptuous music’s dreamy swell,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wild waxed the revel. On an ivory throne</span>
<span class="i0">Inlaid with ebony and gems that shone</span>

<span class="i0">Blazing with diamonds on hilt and blade,—</span>
<span class="i0">The mighty sword that made his foes afraid,—</span>
<span class="i0">And the proud sceptre he was wont to grasp,</span>

<span class="i0">Against the crouching lions (guard that kept</span>
<span class="i0">On either side the throne and never slept),</span>
<span class="i0">Leaned carelessly. And flowing downward o’er</span>
<span class="i0">The ivory steps even to the marble floor,</span>
<span class="i0">Swept the rich royal robes in many a fold</span>
<span class="i0">Of Tyrian purple flecked with yellow gold.</span>
<span class="i0">The jewelled crown his young head scorned to wear,</span>
<span class="i0">More fitly crowned by its own clustering hair,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Mute symbol of great Persia’s power and pride;</span>
<span class="i0">While on his brow some courtier’s hand had placed</span>
<span class="i0">The fairest chaplet monarch ever graced,</span>
<span class="i0">A wreath of dewy roses, fresh and sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">Just brought from out the garden’s cool retreat.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Louder and louder grew the sounds of mirth;</span>
<span class="i0">Faster and faster flowed the red wine forth;</span>

<span class="i0">The monarch’s glory, till the great roof rang;</span>

<span class="i0">To those wild revellers my face to show?</span>

<span class="i0">Were shouting “Vashti! Vashti?”—Sooner far,</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the rays of sun, or moon, or star,</span>

<span class="i0">Pale and dismayed, in wonder and affright,</span>

<span class="i0">My maidens hung around me as I told</span>
<span class="i0">Those seven lord chamberlains, so gray and old,</span>
<span class="i0">To bear this answer back: “It may not be.</span>
<span class="i0">My lord, my king, I cannot come to thee.</span>
<span class="i0">It is not meet that Persia’s queen, like one</span>

<span class="i0">With stern, cold looks they left me. Ah! I knew</span>
<span class="i0">If my dear lord to his best self were true,</span>
<span class="i0">That he would hold me guiltless, and would say,</span>
<span class="i0">“I thank thee, love, that thou didst not obey!”</span>
<span class="i0">But the red wine was ruling o’er his brain;</span>
<span class="i0">The cruel wine that recked not of my pain.</span>
<span class="i0">Up from the angry throng a clamor rose;</span>
<span class="i0">The flattering sycophants were now my foes;</span>
<span class="i0">And evil counsellors about the throne,</span>
<span class="i0">Hiding the jealous joy they dared not own,</span>
<span class="i0">With slow, wise words, and many a virtuous frown,</span>

<span class="i0">Let her not see the king’s face evermore,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor come within his presence as of yore;</span>

<span class="i0">Brought the great book that held the Persian laws,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With clasping arms he raised me to his breast</span>
<span class="i0">And on my brow and lips such kisses pressed</span>
<span class="i0">As one might give the dead. I may not tell</span>
<span class="i0">All the wild words that I remember well.</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! was it joy or was it pain to know</span>
<span class="i0">That not alone I wept my weary woe?</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! I know not. But I know to-day—</span>
<span class="i0">If this be sin, forgive me, Heaven, I pray!—</span>

<h3>DECEMBER 26, 1910 <br /><br /><small>A BALLAD OF MAJOR ANDERSON</small></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, children, leave your playing this dark and stormy night,</span>
<span class="i0">Shut fast the rattling window-blinds, and make the fire burn bright;</span>
<span class="i0">And hear an old man’s story, while loud the fierce winds blow,</span>
<span class="i0">Of gallant Major Anderson and fifty years ago.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was a young man then, boys, but twenty-nine years old,</span>
<span class="i0">And all my comrades knew me for a soldier brave and bold;</span>
<span class="i0">My eye was bright, my step was firm, I measured six feet two,</span>
<span class="i0">And I knew not what it was to shirk when there was work to do.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We were stationed at Fort Moultrie, in Charleston harbor, then,</span>
<span class="i0">A brave band, though a small one, of scarcely seventy men;</span>
<span class="i0">And day and night we waited for the coming of the foe,</span>
<span class="i0">With noble Major Anderson, just fifty years ago.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Were they French or English, ask you? Oh, neither, neither, child!</span>
<span class="i0">We were at peace with other lands, and all the nations smiled</span>
<span class="i0">On the stars and stripes, wherever they floated far and free,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the foes we had to meet we found this side the sea.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But even between brothers bitter feuds will sometimes rise,</span>
<span class="i0">And ’twas the cloud of civil war that darkened in the skies;</span>
<span class="i0">I have not time to tell you how the quarrel first began,</span>
<span class="i0">Or how it grew, till o’er our land the strife like wildfire ran.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will not use hard words, my boys, for I am old and gray,</span>
<span class="i0">And I’ve learned it is an easy thing for the best to go astray;</span>
<span class="i0">Some wrong there was on either part, I do not doubt at all;</span>
<span class="i0">There are two sides to a quarrel—be it great or be it small!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You scarce believe me, children. Grief and doubt are in your eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Fixed steadily upon me in wonder and surprise;</span>
<span class="i0">Don’t forget to thank our Father, when to-night you kneel to pray,</span>
<span class="i0">That an undivided people rule America to-day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We were stationed at Fort Moultrie—but about a mile away,</span>
<span class="i0">The battlements of Sumter stood proudly in the bay;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas by far the best position, as he could not help but know,</span>
<span class="i0">Our gallant Major Anderson, just fifty years ago.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, ’twas just after Christmas, fifty years ago to-night;</span>
<span class="i0">The sky was calm and cloudless, the moon was large and bright;</span>
<span class="i0">At six o’clock the drum beat to call us to parade,</span>
<span class="i0">And not a man suspected the plan that had been laid.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the first thing a soldier learns is that he must obey,</span>
<span class="i0">And that when an order’s given he has not a word to say;</span>
<span class="i0">So when told to man the boats, not a question did we ask,</span>
<span class="i0">But silently, yet eagerly, began our hurried task.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We did a deal of work that night, though our numbers were but few;</span>
<span class="i0">We had all our stores to carry, and our ammunition too;</span>
<span class="i0">And the guard-ship—’twas the Nina—set to watch us in the bay,</span>
<span class="i0">Never dreamed what we were doing, though ’twas almost light as day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We spiked the guns we left behind, and cut the flag-staff down,—</span>
<span class="i0">From its top should float no colors if it might not hold our own,—</span>
<span class="i0">Then we sailed away for Sumter as fast as we could go,</span>
<span class="i0">With our good Major Anderson, just fifty years ago.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never can forget, my boys, how the next day, at noon,</span>
<span class="i0">The drums beat and the band played a stirring martial tune,</span>
<span class="i0">And silently we gathered round the flag-staff, strong and high,</span>
<span class="i0">Forever pointing upward to God’s temple in the sky.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our noble Major Anderson was good as he was brave,</span>
<span class="i0">And he knew without His blessing no banner long could wave;</span>
<span class="i0">So he knelt, with head uncovered, while the chaplain read a prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">And as the last amen was said, the flag rose high in air.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then our loud huzzas rang out, far and widely o’er the sea!</span>
<span class="i0">We shouted for the stars and stripes, the standard of the free!</span>
<span class="i0">Every eye was fixed upon it, every heart beat warm and fast,</span>
<span class="i0">As with eager lips we promised to defend it to the last!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Twas a sight to be remembered, boys—the chaplain with his book,</span>
<span class="i0">Our leader humbly kneeling, with his calm, undaunted look;</span>
<span class="i0">And the officers and men, crushing tears they would not shed,—</span>
<span class="i0">And the blue sea all around us, and the blue sky overhead!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, go to bed, my children, the old man’s story’s told,—</span>
<span class="i0">Stir up the fire before you go, ’tis bitter, bitter cold;</span>
<span class="i0">And I’ll tell you more to-morrow night, when loud the fierce winds blow,</span>
<span class="i0">Of gallant Major Anderson and fifty years ago.</span>

<h3>THE LAST OF SIX</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come in; you are welcome, neighbor; all day I’ve been alone,</span>
<span class="i0">And heard the wailing, wintry wind sweep by with bitter moan;</span>
<span class="i0">And to-night beside my lonely fire, I mutely wonder why</span>
<span class="i0">I, who once wept as others weep, sit here with tearless eye.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To-day this letter came to me. At first I could not brook</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the unfamiliar lines by strangers penned, to look;</span>
<span class="i0">The dread of evil tidings shook my soul with wild alarm—</span>
<span class="i0">But Harry’s in the hospital, and has only lost an arm.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He is the last—the last of six brave boys as e’er were seen!</span>
<span class="i0">How short, to memory’s vision, seem the years that lie between</span>
<span class="i0">This hour and those most blessed ones, when round this hearth’s bright blaze</span>
<span class="i0">They charmed their mother’s heart and eye with all their pretty ways!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My William was the eldest son, and he was first to go.</span>
<span class="i0">It did not at all surprise me, for I knew it would be so,</span>
<span class="i0">From that fearful April Sunday when the news from Sumter came,</span>
<span class="i0">And his lips grew white as ashes, while his eyes were all aflame.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He sprang to join the three months’ men. I could not say him nay,</span>
<span class="i0">Though my heart stood still within me when I saw him march away;</span>
<span class="i0">At the corner of the street he smiled, and waved the flag he bore;</span>
<span class="i0">I never saw him smile again—he was slain at Baltimore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They sent his body back to me, and as we stood around</span>
<span class="i0">His grave, beside his father’s, in yonder burial-ground,</span>
<span class="i0">John laid his hand upon my arm and whispered, “Mother dear,</span>
<span class="i0">I have Willy’s work and mine to do. I cannot loiter here.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I turned and looked at Paul, for he and John were twins, you know,</span>
<span class="i0">Born on a happy Christmas, four-and-twenty years ago;</span>
<span class="i0">I looked upon them both, while my tears fell down like rain,</span>
<span class="i0">For I knew what one had spoken, had been spoken by the twain.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a month or more they left me—the merry, handsome boys,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had kept the old house ringing with their laughter, fun, and noise.</span>
<span class="i0">Then James came home to mind the farm; my younger sons were still</span>
<span class="i0">Mere children, at their lessons in the school-house on the hill.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O days of weary waiting! O days of doubt and dread!</span>
<span class="i0">I feared to read the papers, or to see the lists of dead;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But when full many a battle-storm had left them both unharmed,</span>
<span class="i0">I taught my foolish heart to think the double lives were charmed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their colonel since has told me that no braver boys than they</span>
<span class="i0">Ever rallied round the colors, in the thickest of the fray;</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the wall behind you their swords are hanging still—</span>
<span class="i0">For John was killed at Fair Oaks, and Paul at Malvern Hill.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came the dark days, darker than any known before;</span>
<span class="i0">There was another call for men—“three hundred thousand more;”</span>
<span class="i0">I saw the cloud on Jamie’s brow grow deeper day by day;</span>
<span class="i0">I shrank before the impending blow, and scarce had strength to pray.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And yet at last I bade him go, while on my cheek and brow</span>
<span class="i0">His loving tears and kisses fell; I feel them even now,</span>
<span class="i0">Though the eyes that shed the tears, and the lips so warm on mine</span>
<span class="i0">Are hidden under southern sands, beneath a blasted pine!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He did not die in battle-smoke, but for a weary year</span>
<span class="i0">He languished in close prison walls, a prey to hope and fear;</span>
<span class="i0">I dare not trust myself to think of the fruitless pangs he bore,</span>
<span class="i0">My brain grows wild when in my dreams I count his sufferings o’er.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only two left! I thought the worst was surely over then;</span>
<span class="i0">But lo! at once my school-boy sons sprang up before me—men!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They heard their brothers’ martyr blood call from the hallowed ground;</span>
<span class="i0">A loud, imperious summons that all other voices drowned.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I did not say a single word. My very heart seemed dead.</span>
<span class="i0">What could I do but take the cup, and bow my weary head</span>
<span class="i0">To drink the bitter draught again? I dared not hold them back;</span>
<span class="i0">I would as soon have tried to check the whirlwind on its track.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You know the rest. At Cedar Creek my Frederick bravely fell;</span>
<span class="i0">They say his young arm did its work right nobly and right well;</span>
<span class="i0">His comrades breathe the hero’s name with mingled love and pride;</span>
<span class="i0">I miss the gentle blue-eyed boy, who frolicked at my side.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For me, I ne’er shall weep again. I think my heart is dead;</span>
<span class="i0">I, who could weep for lighter griefs, have now no tears to shed.</span>
<span class="i0">But read this letter, neighbor. There is nothing to alarm,</span>
<span class="i0">For Harry’s in the hospital, and has only lost an arm!</span>

<h3>THE DRUMMER BOY’S BURIAL</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All day long the storm of battle through the startled valley swept;</span>
<span class="i0">All night long the stars in heaven o’er the slain sad vigils kept.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, the ghastly, upturned faces, gleaming whitely through the night!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the heaps of mangled corses in that dim, sepulchral light!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One by one the pale stars faded, and at length the morning broke;</span>
<span class="i0">But not one of all the sleepers on that field of death awoke.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Slowly passed the golden hours of the long bright summer day,</span>
<span class="i0">And upon the field of carnage still the dead unburied lay;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lay there stark and cold, but pleading with a dumb, unceasing prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">For a little dust to hide them from the staring sun and air.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once again the night dropped round them—night so holy and so calm</span>
<span class="i0">That the moonbeams hushed the spirit, like the sound of prayer or psalm.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On a couch of trampled grasses, just apart from all the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Lay a fair young boy, with small hands meekly folded on his breast.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Death had touched him very gently, and he lay as if in sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">Even his mother scarce had shuddered at that slumber, calm and deep.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For a smile of wondrous sweetness lent a radiance to the face,</span>
<span class="i0">And the hand of cunning sculptor could have added naught of grace</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the marble limbs so perfect in their passionless repose,</span>
<span class="i0">Robbed of all save matchless purity by hard, unpitying foes.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the broken drum beside him all his life’s short story told;</span>
<span class="i0">How he did his duty bravely till the death-tide o’er him rolled.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Midnight came with ebon garments and a diadem of stars,</span>
<span class="i0">While right upward in the zenith hung the fiery planet Mars.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hark! a sound of stealthy footsteps and of voices whispering low—</span>
<span class="i0">Was it nothing but the young leaves, or the brooklet’s murmuring flow?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Clinging closely to each other, striving never to look round</span>
<span class="i0">As they passed with silent shudder the pale corses on the ground,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Came two little maidens—sisters—with a light and hasty tread,</span>
<span class="i0">And a look upon their faces, half of sorrow, half of dread.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they did not pause nor falter till, with throbbing hearts, they stood</span>
<span class="i0">Where the Drummer-Boy was lying in that partial solitude.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They had brought some simple garments from their wardrobe’s scanty store,</span>
<span class="i0">And two heavy iron shovels in their slender hands they bore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they quickly knelt beside him, crushing back the pitying tears,</span>
<span class="i0">For they had no time for weeping, nor for any girlish fears.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they robed the icy body, while no glow of maiden shame</span>
<span class="i0">Changed the pallor of their foreheads to a flush of lambent flame.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For their saintly hearts yearned o’er it in that hour of sorest need,</span>
<span class="i0">And they felt that Death was holy and it sanctified the deed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But they smiled and kissed each other when their new, strange task was o’er,</span>
<span class="i0">And the form that lay before them its unwonted garments wore.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then with slow and weary labor a small grave they hollowed out,</span>
<span class="i0">And they lined it with the withered grass and leaves that lay about.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the day was slowly breaking ere their holy work was done,</span>
<span class="i0">And in crimson pomp the morning again heralded the sun.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then those little maidens—they were children of our foes—</span>
<span class="i0">Laid the body of our Drummer-Boy to undisturbed repose.</span>

<h3>THE RIVER OTTER<br /><br /><small>A FRAGMENT</small></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A hundred times the Summer’s fragrant blooms</span>
<span class="i0">Have laden all the air with sweet perfumes;</span>
<span class="i0">A hundred times, along the mountain-side,</span>
<span class="i0">Autumn has flung his crimson banners wide;</span>
<span class="i0">A hundred times has kindly Winter spread</span>
<span class="i0">His snowy mantle o’er the violet’s bed;</span>
<span class="i0">A hundred times has Earth rejoiced to hear</span>
<span class="i0">The Spring’s light footsteps in the forest sere,</span>
<span class="i0">Since on yon grassy knoll the quick, sharp stroke</span>
<span class="i0">Of the young woodman’s axe the silence broke.</span>
<span class="i0">Not then did these encircling hills look down</span>
<span class="i0">On quaint old farmhouse, or on steepled town.</span>
<span class="i0">No church-spires pointed to the arching skies;</span>
<span class="i0">No wandering lovers saw the moon arise;</span>
<span class="i0">No childish laughter mingled with the song</span>
<span class="i0">Of the fair Otter, as it flowed along</span>
<span class="i0">As brightly then as now. Ah! little recked</span>
<span class="i0">The joyous river, when the sunshine flecked</span>
<span class="i0">Its dancing waters, that no human eye</span>
<span class="i0">Gave it glad welcome as it frolicked by!</span>
<span class="i0">The long, uncounted years had come and flown,</span>
<span class="i0">And it had still swept on, unseen, unknown,</span>
<span class="i0">Biding its time. No minstrel sang its praise,</span>
<span class="i0">No poet named it in immortal lays.</span>
<span class="i0">It played no part in legendary lore,</span>
<span class="i0">And young Romance knew not its winding shore.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But in her own loveliness Nature is glad,</span>
<span class="i2">And little she cares for man’s smile or his frown;</span>
<span class="i0">In the robes of her royalty still she is clad,</span>
<span class="i2">Though his eye may behold not her sceptre or crown!</span>
<span class="i0">And over our beautiful Otter the trees</span>
<span class="i0">Swayed lightly as now in the frolicsome breeze;</span>
<span class="i0">And the tremulous violet lifted an eye</span>
<span class="i0">As blue as its own to the laughing blue sky.</span>
<span class="i4">The harebell trembled on its stem</span>
<span class="i6">Down where the rushing waters gleam,</span>
<span class="i4">A sapphire on the broidered hem</span>
<span class="i6">Of some fair Naiad of the stream.</span>
<span class="i4">The buttercups, bright-eyed and bold,</span>
<span class="i4">Held up their chalices of gold</span>
<span class="i4">To catch the sunshine and the dew,</span>
<span class="i4">Gayly as those that bloom for you.</span>
<span class="i4">And deep within the forest shade,</span>
<span class="i4">Where broadest noon mere twilight made,</span>
<span class="i4">Ten thousand small, sweet censers swung,</span>
<span class="i4">And tiny bells by zephyrs rung,</span>
<span class="i4">Made tinkling music till the day</span>
<span class="i4">In solemn splendor died away.</span>
<span class="i4">The woods were full of praise and prayer,</span>
<span class="i4">Although no human tongue was there;</span>
<span class="i4">For every pine and hemlock sung</span>
<span class="i4">The grand cathedral aisles among,</span>
<span class="i4">And every flower that gemmed the sod</span>
<span class="i4">Looked up and whispered, “Thou art God.”</span>
<span class="i4">The birds sung as they sing to-day,</span>
<span class="i4">A song of love and joy alway.</span>
<span class="i4">The brown thrush from its golden throat</span>
<span class="i4">Poured out its long, melodious note;</span>
<span class="i4">The pigeons cooed; the veery threw</span>
<span class="i4">Its mellow thrill from spray to spray;</span>
<span class="i4">The wild night-hawk its trumpet blew,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<span class="i4">And the owl cried, “Tu whit, tu whoo,”</span>
<span class="i4">From set of sun to break of day.</span>
<span class="i4">The partridge reared her fearless brood</span>
<span class="i4">Safe in the darkling solitude,</span>
<span class="i4">And the bald eagle built its nest</span>
<span class="i4">High on the tall cliff’s craggy crest.</span>
<span class="i4">And often, when the still moonlight</span>
<span class="i4">Made all the lonely valley bright,</span>
<span class="i4">Down from the hills its thirst to slake,</span>
<span class="i4">The deer trod softly through the brake;</span>
<span class="i4">While far away the spotted fawn</span>
<span class="i4">Waited the coming of the dawn,</span>
<span class="i4">And trembled when the panther’s scream</span>
<span class="i4">Startled it from a troubled dream.</span>
<span class="i4">The black bear roamed the forest wide;</span>
<span class="i4">The fierce wolf tracked the mountain-side;</span>
<span class="i4">The wild-cat’s silent, stealthy tread</span>
<span class="i4">Was, even there, a fear and dread;</span>
<span class="i4">The red fox barked—a strange, weird sound,</span>
<span class="i4">That woke the slumbering echoes round;</span>
<span class="i4">And the burrowing mink and otter hid</span>
<span class="i4">In their holes the tangled roots amid.</span>
<span class="i4">Lords of their limitless domain,</span>
<span class="i4">Of hill and dale, of mount and plain,</span>
<span class="i4">The wild things dreamed not of the hour</span>
<span class="i4">When they should own their Master’s power!</span>

<span class="i0">Thy pen has written on the scroll of Time?</span>

<span class="i6">Breathing the old, prophetic fire;</span>
<span class="i6">Or harper, in the storied walls</span>

<span class="i6">Where mail-clad men with sword and spear</span>
<span class="i6">Waited entranced the song to hear,</span>
<span class="i6">That through the stormy midnight hour</span>
<span class="i6">Fast held them in its spell of power—</span>
<span class="i6">Ah! never yet did they rehearse,</span>
<span class="i6">In flowing rhyme or stately verse,</span>
<span class="i6">The praise of deeds more nobly done,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

<span class="i0">That the day of great deeds and great thought is not o’er;</span>
<span class="i0">That the courage undaunted, the far-reaching faith,</span>
<span class="i0">The strength that unshaken looks calmly on death,</span>
<span class="i0">The self-abnegation that hastens to lay</span>
<span class="i0">Its all on the altar, have not passed away.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast taught us that “country” is more than a name;</span>
<span class="i0">That honor unsullied is better than fame;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast proved that while man can still battle for truth,</span>
<span class="i0">Even boyhood can give up the promise of youth,</span>
<span class="i0">And, yielding its life with a smile and a sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Say, “’Tis sweet for my God and my country to die.”</span>

<span class="i0">Has lavished thy bounties on friend and on foe,</span>
<span class="i0">Like the rain that, descending, falls softly and slow</span>
<span class="i0">On the just and the unjust, and never may know</span>
<span class="i0">The one from the other. When thy story is told</span>
<span class="i0">By some age that looks backward and calls thee “the old,”</span>
<span class="i0">It shall puzzle its sages, all great as thou art,</span>
<span class="i0">To tell which was greatest, thy head or thy heart!</span>
<span class="i12">Mighty words thy lips have spoken—</span>
<span class="i12">Strongest fetters thou hast broken—</span>
<span class="i12">And in tones like those of thunder,</span>
<span class="i12">When the clouds are rent asunder,</span>

<h3>FRIAR ANSELMO</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Friar Anselmo</span> for a secret sin</span>
<span class="i0">Sat bowed with grief the convent cell within;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor dared, such was his shame, to lift his eyes</span>
<span class="i0">To the low wall whereon, in dreadful guise,</span>
<span class="i0">The dead <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hung upon the cursèd tree,</span>
<span class="i0">Frowning, he thought, upon his misery.</span>
<span class="i0">What was his sin it matters not to tell.</span>
<span class="i2">But he was young and strong, the records say:</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps he wearied of his narrow cell;</span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps he longed to work, as well as pray;</span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps his heart too warmly beat that day!</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps—for life is long—the weary road</span>
<span class="i0">That he must travel, bearing as a load</span>
<span class="i0">The slow, monotonous hours that, one by one,</span>
<span class="i0">Dragged in a lengthening chain from sun to sun,</span>
<span class="i0">Appalled his eager spirit, and his vow</span>
<span class="i0">Pressed like an iron hand upon his brow.</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some dream of love, of home, of wife,</span>
<span class="i0">Had stirred this tumult in his lonely life,</span>
<span class="i0">Tempting his soul to barter heavenly bliss,</span>
<span class="i0">And sell its birthright for a woman’s kiss!</span>
<span class="i0">At all events, the struggle had been hard;</span>
<span class="i0">And as a bird from the glad ether barred,</span>
<span class="i0">So had he beat his wings till, bruised and torn,</span>
<span class="i0">He wished that night he never had been born!</span>
<span class="i0">And still the dead <span class="smcap">Christ</span> on the cursèd tree</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed but to mock his hopeless misery;</span>
<span class="i0">Still Mary mother turned her eyes away,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor saint nor angel bent to hear him pray!</span>

<span class="i0">The calm, cold moonlight through the casement shone;</span>
<span class="i0">Weird shadows darkened on the floor of stone;</span>
<span class="i0">Without, what solemn splendors! and within</span>
<span class="i0">What fearful wrestlings with despair and sin!</span>
<span class="i0">Sudden and loud the cloister bell outrang;</span>
<span class="i0">Afar a door swung to with sullen clang;</span>
<span class="i0">And overhead he heard the rhythmic beat,</span>
<span class="i0">The measured monotone of many feet</span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the chapel for the midnight prayer.</span>
<span class="i0">Black wings seemed hovering round him in the air,</span>
<span class="i0">Beating him back when with a stifled moan</span>
<span class="i0">He would have sought the holy altar stone.</span>
<span class="i0">Then with a swift, sharp cry, prostrate he fell</span>
<span class="i0">Before the crucifix. “The gates of hell</span>
<span class="i0">Shall not prevail against me!” loud he cried,</span>
<span class="i0">Stretching his arms to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the crucified.</span>

<span class="i0">Thine awful passion, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, deliver me!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Was it a dream? The taunting demons fled;</span>
<span class="i0">Through the dim cell a wondrous glory spread;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the air was filled with rare perfumes</span>
<span class="i0">Wafted from censers rich with heavenly blooms.</span>
<span class="i0">Transfigured stood the <span class="smcap">Christ</span> before his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white samite, woven in Paradise,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the empty cross upon the wall</span>
<span class="i0">Streamed a wide splendor that encompassed all!</span>
<span class="i0">Was it a dream? Anselmo’s sight grew dim;</span>
<span class="i0">The cloistered chamber seemed to reel and swim;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet well his spirit knew the glorious guest,</span>
<span class="i0">And all his manhood rose to meet the test.</span>
<span class="i0">“What wilt Thou have me, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to do?” he cried</span>
<span class="i2">With pallid lips, and kissed the sacred feet.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And then in accents strangely calm, yet sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">These words he heard from <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the crucified,</span>
<span class="i0">The pitying <span class="smcap">Christ</span> his inmost soul who read,</span>
<span class="i0">With all its wild unrest, its doubt and dread:</span>
<span class="i0">“<span class="smcap">Make thou a copy of My Holy Word!</span>”</span>
<span class="i0">Then mystic presences about him stirred;</span>
<span class="i0">The vision faded. At the dawn of day</span>
<span class="i0">Prostrate and pallid in the dusk he lay.</span>
<span class="i0">Was it a dream? <span class="smcap">God</span> knows! The narrow cell</span>
<span class="i0">Wore the old aspect he had learned so well,</span>
<span class="i0">And from the crucifix upon the wall</span>
<span class="i0">No glory streamed illuminating all!</span>
<span class="i0">Yet still a subtile fragrance filled the room;</span>
<span class="i0">And looking round him in the soft, gray gloom,</span>
<span class="i0">Anselmo saw upon the fretted floor</span>
<span class="i0">An eagle’s quill that this grave legend bore:</span>
<span class="i0">“He works most nobly for his fellow-men</span>
<span class="i0">Who gives My word to them, by tongue or pen!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Henceforth Anselmo prayed, but worked as well,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor felt the bondage of his cloister cell;</span>
<span class="i0">For all his soul was filled with high intent,</span>
<span class="i0">He had no dream since its accomplishment—</span>
<span class="i0">To make a copy of the Holy Word,</span>
<span class="i0">Fairer than eye had seen, or ear had heard,</span>
<span class="i0">Or heart conceived of! Day by day he wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">His fingers guided by a single thought;</span>
<span class="i0">Forming each letter with the tenderest care,</span>
<span class="i0">With points of richest color here and there;</span>
<span class="i0">With birds on swaying boughs, and butterflies</span>
<span class="i2">Poised on gay wings o’er sprays of eglantine;</span>
<span class="i2">With tangled tracery of flower and vine</span>
<span class="i2">Through which gleamed cherub faces, half divine;</span>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">St. Gudula’s bells were chiming for the midnight, sad and slow,</span>
<span class="i0">In the ancient town of Brussels, many and many a year ago,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And St. Michael, poised so grandly on his lofty, airy height,</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed transfigured in the glory of the full moon’s tender light,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When, a fair and saintly maiden crowned with locks of palest gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Rena stood beside her lover, son of Hildebrand the Bold.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She with grief and tears was pallid; but his face was hard and stern:</span>
<span class="i0">All the passion of his being in his dark eyes seemed to burn.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Never dream that I will give thee back thy plighted faith,” he cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“By St. Michael’s sword I swear it, thou, my love, shalt be my bride!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Nay, but hear me,” she responded; “hear the words that I must speak;</span>
<span class="i0">I must speak, and thou must hearken, though my heart is like to break.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yestermorn, as I sat spinning blithely at my cottage door,</span>
<span class="i0">Straightway fell a stately shadow in the sunshine on the floor;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And a figure stood before me, so majestic and so grand,</span>
<span class="i0">That I knew it in a moment for the mighty Hildebrand—</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stood and gazed on me till downward at my feet the distaff dropped,</span>
<span class="i0">And in all my veins the pulsing of the swift life-current stopped.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Thou art Rena,’ then he uttered, and he swore a dreadful oath,</span>
<span class="i0">And the tempest of his anger beat on me and on us both.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘She who thinks to wed with Volmar must have lands and gold,’ said he,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Or must come of noble lineage, fit to mate with mine and me!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou art but a peasant maiden, empty-handed, lowly born;</span>
<span class="i0">All the ladies of my castle would look down on thee with scorn.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even he will weary of thee when his passion once is spent,</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly cursing her who doomed him to an endless discontent!’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I, trembling, rose up slowly, and I looked him in the face,</span>
<span class="i0">Though the dreadful frown it wore seemed to darken all the place.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Sir, I thank you for this warning,’ said I, speaking low and clear,</span>
<span class="i0">‘But the laughter of your ladies I must teach my heart to bear.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the rest—your son is noble—and my simple womanhood</span>
<span class="i0">He will hold in loving honor, as a saint the holy rood!’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! then his stern face whitened, and a bitter laugh laughed he:</span>
<span class="i0">‘Truly this my son is noble, and he shall not wed with thee.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hear my words now, and remember! for by this good sword I swear,</span>

<span class="i0">If he dares to place a wedding-ring upon your dowerless hand,</span>
<span class="i0">On his head shall fall a father’s curse—the curse of Hildebrand!’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, my Volmar! Then the earth rocked, and I fell down in a swoon;</span>
<span class="i0">When I woke the room was silent; it was past the hour of noon;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I waited for thy coming, as the captive waits for death,</span>
<span class="i0">With a mingled dread and longing, and a half-abated breath!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Straight the young man bowed before her, as before a holy shrine:</span>
<span class="i0">“Never hand of high-born lady was more richly dowered than thine!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What care I for gold or honors, or—my—father’s—curse?” he said;</span>
<span class="i0">But the words died out in shudders, and his face grew like the dead.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she twined her white arms round him, and she murmured, sweet and low,</span>
<span class="i0">As the night wind breathing softly over banks where violets blow:</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘He who is accursed of father, he shall be accursed of God,’</span>
<span class="i0">Long ago said one who followed where the holy prophets trod.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kiss me once, then, O my Volmar! just once more, my Volmar dear,</span>
<span class="i0">Even as you would kiss my white lips if I lay upon my bier!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For a gulf as dark as death has opened wide ’twixt thee and me;</span>
<span class="i0">Neither thou nor I can cross it, and thy wife I may not be!”</span>
</div></div></div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once again the bells of midnight chimed from St. Gudula’s towers,</span>
<span class="i0">While St. Michael watched the city slumbering through the ghostly hours.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But no slumber came to Rena where she moaned in bitter pain,</span>
<span class="i0">For the anguish of that parting wrought its work on heart and brain.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Suddenly the air grew heavy as with magical perfume,</span>
<span class="i0">And a weird and wondrous splendor filled the dim and silent room.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the middle of the chamber stood a lady fair and sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">With bright tresses falling softly to her small and sandalled feet.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flushed her cheeks were as a wild rose, and the glory of her eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Was the laughing light and glory of the kindling morning skies.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Airy robes of lightest tissue from her white arms floated free;</span>
<span class="i0">They seemed woven of the mist that curls above the azure sea,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wrought in curious devices, star and wheel and leaf and flower,</span>
<span class="i0">That, like frost upon a window-pane, might vanish in an hour.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In her hands she bore a cushion, quaintly fashioned, strangely set</span>
<span class="i0">With small silver pins that spanned it like a branching coronet;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And from threads of finest texture swung light bobbins to and fro,</span>
<span class="i0">As the lady stood illumined in the weird and wondrous glow.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a single word she uttered; but, as silent as a shade,</span>
<span class="i0">Down the room she swiftly glided and beside the startled maid</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Knelt, a radiant vision, smiling into Rena’s wondering eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Giving arch yet gracious answer to her tremulous surprise.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she laid the satin cushion on the wondering maiden’s knee,</span>
<span class="i0">And to all her mute bewilderment, no syllable spake she.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, as in and out and round about, the silver pins among,</span>
<span class="i0">Flashed the white hand of the lady, and the shining bobbins swung,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo! a web of fairy lightness like the misty robe she wore,</span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly grew beneath her fingers, drifting downward to the floor!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as Rena looked and wondered, inch by inch the marvel grew,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the eastern windows brightened as the gray dawn struggled through.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the lady’s hand touched Rena’s, and she pointed far away,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the palace towers were gleaming in the first red light of day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when once again the maiden turned her glance within the room,</span>
<span class="i0">With the lady fair had vanished all the splendor and perfume.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the satin cushion lay there, quaintly fashioned, strangely set</span>
<span class="i0">With the silver pins that spanned it like a branching coronet;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the light web she had woven lay in drifts upon the floor,</span>
<span class="i0">Like the mist wreaths resting softly on some lone, enchanted shore!</span>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Slowly Rena raised the cushion, with her sweet eyes shining clear,</span>
<span class="i0">Lightly tossed the fairy bobbins, half in gladness, half in fear.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! not vain had been her watching as the lovely lady wrought;</span>
<span class="i0">All the magic of her fingers her own cunning hand had caught!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many a day above the cushion Rena’s peerless head was bent,</span>

<span class="i0">A fair dowry fit to match the pride of Hildebrand the Bold!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she braided up her long hair, and put on her russet gown,</span>
<span class="i0">And with wicker basket laden passed she swiftly through the town,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the palace where Queen Ildegar, with dames of high degree,</span>
<span class="i0">In a lofty oriel window sat, the beauteous morn to see.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the door-way she stood meekly, till the queen said, “Maiden fair,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eagerly she raised her blue eyes, hovering smiles and tears between,</span>
<span class="i0">Then across the room she glided, and knelt down before the queen.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lifting up the wicker cover, “Saints in heaven!” cried Ildegar,</span>
<span class="i0">“Here are tissues fit for angels, wrought with wreath and point and star,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In most curious devices! Never saw I aught so rare—</span>
<span class="i0">Where found you these frail webs woven of the lightest summer air?”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Well they may be fit for angels,” said she, underneath her breath;</span>
<span class="i0">“O my lady, hear a story that is strange and true as death.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ere yet the tale was ended, up rose good Queen Ildegar,</span>
<span class="i0">And she sent her knights and pages to the castle riding far.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Bring me Hildebrand and Volmar, ere the sun goes down!” she cried,</span>

<span class="i0">I will buy these airy wonders, and this maiden in her hand</span>
<span class="i0">Shall a dowry hold as royal as the noblest in the land.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they combed her shining tresses, and they brought her robes of silk,</span>
<span class="i0">Broidered thick with gold and silver, on a ground as white as milk.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she whispered, “Sweetest ladies, let me wear my russet gown,</span>

<span class="i0">Then the good queen, smiling brightly, from the wicker basket took</span>
<span class="i0">Lightest web of quaintest pattern, and its filmy folds out-shook.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With her own white hand she laid it over Rena’s golden hair,</span>

<span class="i0">Burned on her cheek a sudden flame</span>

<span class="i0">Again unto Christ the Crucified.</span>
<span class="i0">The rose had fled from her cheeks so red,</span>
<span class="i0">But still she knelt by his side and said,</span>

<span class="i0">The drifting snow in the village-street,</span>

<span class="i0">Yet still I dream, O heart of mine!</span>
<span class="i2">Of a beautiful city that lies afar;</span>

<span class="i6">We sought the barren sand</span>

<span class="i6">What could we do but go?</span>

<span class="i6">Through which we onward passed</span>
<span class="i0">Into a chamber lowlier than the last,</span>

<h3>VALDEMAR</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within a city quaint and old,</span>
<span class="i0">When reigned King Alcinor the Bold,</span>

<span class="i0">And moulded to a statelier grace</span>
<span class="i0">The stalwart form that trod the earth</span>
<span class="i0">As it had been of princely birth.</span>
<span class="i0">So fair, so strong, so brave was he,</span>

<span class="i0">That Alcinor upon his throne</span>
<span class="i0">No kinglier gifts from life could own</span>
<span class="i0">Than those it brought from near and far</span>

<span class="i0">Then, smiling, touched a heap of clay.</span>

<h3>THE ARMORER’S ERRAND<br /><br /><small>A BALLAD OF 1775</small></h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where the far skies soared clear and bright</span>
<span class="i0">From mountain height to mountain height,</span>
<span class="i0">In the heart of a forest old and gray,</span>
<span class="i0">Castleton slept one Sabbath day—</span>
<span class="i0">Slept and dreamed, on the seventh of May,</span>
<span class="i0">Seventeen hundred and seventy-five.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But hark! a humming, like bees in a hive;</span>
<span class="i0">Hark to the shouts—“They come! they come!”</span>
<span class="i0">Hark to the sound of the fife and drum!</span>
<span class="i0">For up from the south two hundred men—</span>
<span class="i0">Two hundred and fifty—from mount and glen,</span>
<span class="i0">While the deep woods rang with their rallying cry</span>
<span class="i0">Of “Ticonderoga! Fort Ti! Fort Ti!”</span>
<span class="i0">Swept into the town with a martial tread,</span>
<span class="i0">Ethan Allen marching ahead!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next day the village was all astir</span>
<span class="i0">With unwonted tumult and hurry. There were</span>
<span class="i0">Gatherings here and gatherings there,</span>
<span class="i0">A feverish heat in the very air,</span>
<span class="i0">The ominous sound of tramping feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And eager groups in the dusty street.</span>
<span class="i0">To Eben’s forge strode Gershom Beach</span>
<span class="i0">(Idle it stood, and its master away);</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Blacksmith and armorer stout was he,</span>
<span class="i0">First in the fight and first in the breach,</span>
<span class="i0">And first in work where a man should be.</span>
<span class="i0">“I’ll borrow your tools, my friend,” he said,</span>
<span class="i0">“And temper these blades if I lose my head!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he wrought away till the sun went down,</span>
<span class="i0">And silence fell on the turbulent town;</span>
<span class="i0">And the flame of the forge through the darkness glowed,</span>
<span class="i0">A square of light on the sandy road.</span>
<span class="i0">Then over the threshold a shadow fell,</span>
<span class="i0">And he heard a voice that he knew right well.</span>
<span class="i0">It was Ethan Allen’s. He cried: “I knew</span>
<span class="i0">Where the forge-fire blazed I must look for you!</span>
<span class="i0">But listen! more arduous work than this,</span>
<span class="i0">Lying in wait for someone is;</span>
<span class="i0">And tempering blades is only play</span>
<span class="i0">To the task I set for him this day—</span>
<span class="i0">Or this night, rather.” A grim smile played</span>
<span class="i0">O’er the armorer’s face as his hand he stayed.</span>
<span class="i0">“Say on. I never have shirked,” said he;</span>
<span class="i0">“What may this wonderful task-work be?”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To go by the light of the evening star</span>
<span class="i0">On an urgent errand, swift and far—</span>
<span class="i0">From town to town and from farm to farm</span>
<span class="i0">To carry the warning and sound the alarm!</span>
<span class="i0">Wake Rutland and Pittsford! Rouse Neshobè, too,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the fair valley the Otter runs through—</span>
<span class="i0">For we need more men! Make no delay,</span>
<span class="i0">But hasten, hasten, upon your way!”</span>
<span class="i0">He doffed his apron, he tightened his belt,</span>
<span class="i0">To fasten the straps of his leggings he knelt.</span>
<span class="i0">“Ere the clock strikes nine,” said Gershom Beach,</span>
<span class="i0">“Friend Allen, I will be out of reach;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And I pledge you my word, ere dawn of day</span>
<span class="i0">Guns and men shall be under way.</span>
<span class="i0">But where shall I send these minute-men?”</span>
<span class="i0">“Do you know Hand’s Cove?” said Allen then,</span>
<span class="i0">“On the shore of Champlain? Let them meet me there</span>
<span class="i0">By to-morrow night, be it foul or fair!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Good-by, I’m off!” Then down the road</span>
<span class="i0">As if on seven-league boots he strode,</span>
<span class="i0">While Allen watched from the forge’s door</span>
<span class="i0">Till the stalwart form he could see no more.</span>
<span class="i0">Into the woods passed Gershom Beach;</span>
<span class="i0">By nine of the clock he was out of reach.</span>
<span class="i0">But still, as his will his steps outran,</span>
<span class="i0">He said to himself, with a laugh, “Old man,</span>
<span class="i0">Never a minute have you to lose,</span>
<span class="i0">Never a minute to pick or choose;</span>
<span class="i0">For sixty miles in twenty-four hours</span>
<span class="i0">Is surely enough to try your powers.</span>
<span class="i0">So square your shoulders and speed away</span>
<span class="i0">With never a halt by night or day.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Twas a moonless night; but over his head</span>
<span class="i0">The stars a tremulous lustre shed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the breath of the woods grew strangely sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">As he crushed the wild ferns under his feet,</span>
<span class="i0">And trampled the shy arbutus blooms,</span>
<span class="i0">With their hoarded wealth of rare perfumes.</span>
<span class="i0">He sniffed as he went. “It seems to me</span>
<span class="i0">There are May-flowers here, but I cannot see.</span>
<span class="i0">I’ve read of the ‘hush of the silent night’;</span>
<span class="i0">Now hark! there’s a wolf on yonder height;</span>
<span class="i0">There’s a snarling catamount prowling round;</span>
<span class="i0">Every inch of the ‘silence’ is full of sound;</span>
<span class="i0">The night-birds cry; the whip-poor-wills</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Call to each other from all the hills;</span>
<span class="i0">A scream comes down from the eagle’s nest;</span>
<span class="i0">The bark of a fox from the cliff’s tall crest;</span>
<span class="i0">The owls hoot; and the very trees</span>
<span class="i0">Have something to say to every breeze!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The paths were few and the ways were rude</span>
<span class="i0">In the depths of that virgin solitude.</span>
<span class="i0">The Indian’s trail and the hunter’s tracks,</span>
<span class="i0">The trees scarred deep by the settler’s axe,</span>
<span class="i0">Or a cow-path leading to the creek,—</span>
<span class="i0">These were the signs he had to seek;</span>
<span class="i0">Save where, it may be, he chanced to hit</span>
<span class="i0">The Crown Point road and could follow it—</span>
<span class="i0">The road by the British troops hewn out</span>
<span class="i0">Under General Amherst in fifty-nine,</span>
<span class="i0">When he drove the French from the old redoubt,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor waited to give the countersign!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The streams were many and swift and clear;</span>
<span class="i0">But there was no bridge, or far or near.</span>
<span class="i0">It was midnight when he paused to hear</span>
<span class="i0">At Rutland, the roar of the waterfall,</span>
<span class="i0">And found a canoe by the river’s edge,</span>
<span class="i0">In a tangled thicket of reeds and sedge.</span>
<span class="i0">With a shout and a cheer, on the rushing tide</span>
<span class="i0">He launched it and flew to the other side;</span>
<span class="i0">Then giving his message, on he sped,</span>
<span class="i0">By the light of the pale stars overhead,</span>
<span class="i0">Past the log church below Pine Hill,</span>
<span class="i0">And the graveyard opposite. All was still,</span>
<span class="i0">And the one lone sleeper lying there</span>
<span class="i0">Stirred not either for cry or prayer.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only pausing to give the alarm</span>
<span class="i0">At rude log cabin and lonely farm.</span>
<span class="i0">From hamlet to hamlet he hurries along,</span>
<span class="i0">Borne on by a purpose deep and strong.</span>
<span class="i0">Look! there’s a deer in the forest glade,</span>
<span class="i0">Stealing along like a silent shade!</span>
<span class="i0">Hark to the loon that cries and moans</span>
<span class="i0">With a living grief in its human tones!</span>
<span class="i0">At Pittsford the light begins to grow</span>
<span class="i0">In the wakening east; and drifting slow,</span>
<span class="i0">From valley and river and wild-wood, rise,</span>
<span class="i0">Like the smoke of a morning sacrifice,</span>
<span class="i0">Clouds of translucent, silver mist,</span>
<span class="i0">Flushing to rose and amethyst;</span>
<span class="i0">While thrush and robin and bluebird sing</span>
<span class="i0">Till the woods with jubilant music ring!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was day at last! He looked around,</span>
<span class="i0">With a firmer tread on the springing ground;</span>
<span class="i0">“Now the men will be all afield,” said he,</span>
<span class="i0">“And that will save many a step for me.</span>
<span class="i0">Each man will be ready to go; but still,</span>
<span class="i0">I must confess, if I’d had my will,</span>
<span class="i0">I’d have waited till after planting-time,</span>
<span class="i0">For now the season is in its prime.</span>
<span class="i0">The young green leaves of the oak-tree here</span>
<span class="i0">Are just the size of a squirrel’s ear;</span>
<span class="i0">And I’ve known no rule, since I was born,</span>
<span class="i0">Safer than that for planting corn!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He threaded the valleys, he climbed the hills,</span>
<span class="i0">He forded the rivers, he leaped the rills,</span>
<span class="i0">While still to his call, like minute-men</span>
<span class="i0">Booted and spurred, from mount and glen,</span>
<span class="i0">The settlers rallied. But on he went</span>
<span class="i0">Like an arrow shot from a bow, unspent,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The might of the waterfall thundered in air;</span>
<span class="i0">Then across to the lake, six leagues and more,</span>
<span class="i0">Where Hand’s Cove lay in the bending shore.</span>
<span class="i0">The goal was reached. He dropped to the ground</span>
<span class="i0">In a deep ravine, without word or sound;</span>
<span class="i0">And Sleep, the restorer, bade him rest</span>
<span class="i0">Like a weary child, on the earth’s brown breast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At midnight he woke with a quick heart-beat,</span>
<span class="i0">And sprang with a will to his throbbing feet;—</span>
<span class="i0">For armed men swarmed in the dim ravine,</span>
<span class="i0">And Ethan Allen, as proud of mien</span>
<span class="i0">As a king on his throne, smiled down on him,</span>
<span class="i0">While he stretched and straightened each stiffened limb.</span>
<span class="i0">“Nay, nay,” said the Colonel, “take your rest,</span>

<h3>A MATER DOLOROSA</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then down the street came Giacomo, flushed</span>
<span class="i0">With wine and laughter. I can see him now,</span>
<span class="i0">With Giulio, Florian, and young Angelo,</span>
<span class="i0">Arms interlaced, hands clasped, a roisterous crew</span>
<span class="i0">Of merry, harmless idlers. Ah, so long,</span>
<span class="i0">So long ago it was! Yet I can see</span>
<span class="i0">Just how the campanile shone that night</span>
<span class="i0">Like molten silver, while its carven saints</span>
<span class="i0">Prayed in the moonlight. Then a shadow crept</span>
<span class="i0">Over the moon’s face; and it grew so dark</span>
<span class="i0">That the red star in Giacomo’s cap</span>
<span class="i0">Paled and went out, and Giulio’s shoulder-clasp</span>
<span class="i0">Lost all the lustre of its burnished gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And faded out of sight. Strange, how we lose</span>
<span class="i0">So much we would remember, and yet keep</span>
<span class="i0">Trifles like this until the day of doom!</span>
<span class="i0">They had swept past me where I stood in shade</span>
<span class="i0">When Giacomo turned. Just then the moon</span>
<span class="i0">Shone out again, illumining the place,</span>
<span class="i0">And he paused laughing, catching sight of me</span>
<span class="i0">There by the fountain.—Nay, sweet Signor, nay!</span>
<span class="i0">I was young then, and some said I was fair;</span>
<span class="i0">But I loved not Giacomo, nor he me.—</span>
<span class="i0">Back he came crying, “Little one, take heed!</span>
<span class="i0">Know you Fra Alessandro? He would have</span>
<span class="i0">A model for his picture. Go you then</span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow to his studio and say</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Giacomo sent you. At the convent there,</span>
<span class="i0">Near Santa Croce.”</span>
<span class="i8">So I thither went</span>
<span class="i0">Early next morning, trembling as I stole</span>
<span class="i0">Into the master’s presence. A grave man</span>
<span class="i0">Of most unworldly aspect, with bowed head</span>
<span class="i0">And pale chin resting on his long, thin hand,</span>
<span class="i0">He sat before an easel, lost in thought.</span>
<span class="i0">“Giacomo sent me,” said I, creeping in,</span>
<span class="i0">And then stood breathless. Swift as light he turned,</span>
<span class="i0">But smiled not, spoke not, while his searching eye</span>
<span class="i0">For minutes that seemed hours scanned my face,</span>
<span class="i0">Reading it line by line. Signor, it seemed</span>
<span class="i0">As if the judgment-day had come, and God</span>
<span class="i0">Sat on the great white throne! At length he spoke,</span>
<span class="i0">Nodding as one content—“To-morrow morn</span>
<span class="i0">I pray thee come thou hither. Canst thou bring</span>
<span class="i0">A little child with thee—some fair, sweet child</span>
<span class="i0">Whose eyes are like the morning?”</span>
<span class="i8">Then I said,</span>
<span class="i0">Bethinking me of Beppo’s little boy</span>
<span class="i0">Whose mother died last week—“Yes, I will come</span>
<span class="i0">Surely, my father, and will bring with me</span>
<span class="i0">The fairest child in Florence.” “It is well,”</span>
<span class="i0">Softly he answered, and a sudden light</span>
<span class="i0">Made his pale face all glorious. At the door</span>
<span class="i0">I paused, and looking backward saw him bow</span>
<span class="i0">Before the easel as before a shrine.</span>
<span class="i0">I know not if he prayed, but never saint</span>
<span class="i0">Had aspect more divine.</span>
<span class="i8">Next day I went</span>
<span class="i0">With little Nello to the studio.</span>
<span class="i0">Impatiently the Frate greeted us,</span>
<span class="i0">Palette in hand. “So!—Thou art come at last?”</span>
<span class="i0">But as I drew the cap from Nello’s head</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the moist tendrils of his golden hair</span>
<span class="i0">Fell softly on his forehead, he cried out:</span>
<span class="i0">“The boy is like an angel! And thy face,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy face, my daughter, I have seen in dreams,</span>
<span class="i0">But in dreams only. So, then, stand thou there,</span>
<span class="i0">And let the boy sit throned upon thine arm,</span>
<span class="i0">As thus, or thus.”</span>
<span class="i8">The child was half afraid;</span>
<span class="i0">And round my neck he clasped his clinging arms,</span>
<span class="i0">Lifting his face to mine, a questioning face,</span>
<span class="i0">Filled with soft, startled wonder. While I held</span>
<span class="i0">Him close and soothed him, Alessandro cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“O, hold him thus forever! Do not stir!</span>
<span class="i0">I paint a virgin for an altar-piece.</span>
<span class="i0">And thou and this fair child——”</span>
<span class="i8">Even while he spoke</span>
<span class="i0">He turned back to the easel; but I sprang</span>
<span class="i0">From the low pedestal, and, with the boy</span>
<span class="i0">Still in my arms, I fell down at his feet.</span>
<span class="i0">“Not that, not that, my father!” swift I cried,</span>
<span class="i0">While my hot forehead touched his garment’s hem;</span>
<span class="i0">“Not that, for God’s sake! Paint me otherwise.</span>
<span class="i0">Paint me as martyr, or as Magdalen,</span>
<span class="i0">As saint, or sibyl—whatsoe’er you will,</span>
<span class="i0">Only not that, not that!”</span>
<span class="i8">Smiling he stooped</span>
<span class="i0">And raised me from the ground, and took the child</span>
<span class="i0">In unaccustomed arms all tenderly,</span>
<span class="i0">Placing his brown beads in the dimpled hand.</span>
<span class="i0">“But why ‘not that,’ my daughter? Nothing else</span>
<span class="i0">Ever paint I! Not saint, nor Magdalen,</span>
<span class="i0">Only the Virgin and her Holy Child.”</span>
<span class="i4">Then suddenly I saw it all—the light</span>
<span class="i0">Dim in cathedral aisles, the kneeling crowds,</span>
<span class="i0">The swinging censers, candles burning clear,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With flash of jewels, splendor and perfume,</span>
<span class="i0">The high white altar, and above a face,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>My</i> face, pale shining through the scented gloom</span>
<span class="i0">Like a lone star! Then in the hush a voice</span>
<span class="i0">Chanted “Hail, Mary”—and my heart stood still.</span>
<span class="i0">I who had been a sinner, could I dare</span>
<span class="i0">Thus to mock God and man? Low at his feet</span>
<span class="i0">Again I fell, and there I told him all</span>
<span class="i0">As he had been my soul’s confessor, poured</span>
<span class="i0">My very heart out. Signor, life is hard</span>
<span class="i0">And cruel to child-women, when the street</span>
<span class="i0">Is their sole nursing mother. I had had</span>
<span class="i0">No friend, no home, save when old Barbara</span>
<span class="i0">In some rare mood of pity let me creep</span>
<span class="i0">Under her wing for shelter. Then she died,</span>
<span class="i0">And even that poor semblance of a home</span>
<span class="i0">Was mine no longer. Yet, as the years went on,</span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dust and moil I grew as tall</span>
<span class="i0">And fair as lily in a garden plot,</span>
<span class="i0">Shut in by ivied cloisters—Let it pass!—</span>
<span class="i0">God knows how girls are tempted when false love</span>
<span class="i0">Comes with beguiling words and tender lips,</span>
<span class="i0">Promising all things, and their barren lives</span>
<span class="i0">Break into sudden bloom as when a bud</span>
<span class="i0">Unfolds its shining petals in the sun</span>
<span class="i0">And joys to be a rose!</span>
<span class="i23">No word he spake,</span>
<span class="i0">Fra Alessandro, sitting mute and pale.</span>
<span class="i0">But Nello, wondering at my sighs and tears,</span>
<span class="i0">Dropped the brown rosary and thrust his hands</span>
<span class="i0">Into the shining masses of my hair,</span>
<span class="i0">Pulling the bodkin out, and lifted up</span>
<span class="i0">My wet, wan face to kiss it. God is good;</span>
<span class="i0">And even in that dark hour a thrill of joy</span>
<span class="i0">Ran through my soul as the pure lips met mine.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Still I knelt, waiting judgment, with the child</span>
<span class="i0">Clasped to my bosom, daring not to raise</span>
<span class="i0">My eyes to the face above me. Well I knew</span>
<span class="i0">It was the priest’s face, not the painter’s, now!</span>
<span class="i0">Was it his voice that through the silence stole,</span>
<span class="i0">“A little child shall lead them,” murmuring low?</span>
<span class="i0">Just for one instant on my head a hand</span>
<span class="i0">Fell as in benediction. Then he said</span>
<span class="i0">“Arise, my daughter, and come thou with me</span>
<span class="i0">Where bide the holy sisters of St. Clare,</span>
<span class="i0">Ruled by their abbess, saintliest of all</span>
<span class="i0">The saintly sisterhood. By work and prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">Fasting and penance, thou shalt purge thy soul</span>
<span class="i0">Of all iniquity, and make it clean.”</span>
<span class="i0">Startled I answered him—“But who will care</span>
<span class="i0">For Nello then? His mother died last week,</span>
<span class="i0">And Beppo’s heart is buried in her grave—</span>
<span class="i0">He cares not for the child, nor gives him love.”</span>
<span class="i0">But with a wide sweep of his beckoning arm</span>
<span class="i0">Down the long cloisters strode he, and across</span>
<span class="i0">The heated pavement of the market-place,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor looked to see if we were following him</span>
<span class="i0">Until he paused before the convent gate;</span>
<span class="i0">Then rang the bell, and in the pause I heard</span>
<span class="i0">The sisters chanting, and grew faint with shame.</span>
<span class="i0">“Fear not, my child,” Fra Alessandro said.</span>
<span class="i0">“Here comes Jacinta. Go you in with her,</span>
<span class="i0">And straightway tell the abbess all the tale</span>
<span class="i0">Told unto me this day. Farewell! ”The gate</span>
<span class="i0">Swung to with iron clang, and Nello’s arms</span>
<span class="i0">Half strangled me as round my neck he clung,</span>
<span class="i0">Awed by the holy stillness.</span>
<span class="i28">Since that hour</span>
<span class="i0">I with the humble sisters of St. Clare</span>
<span class="i0">Have given myself to deeds of mercy, works</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Meet for repentance, ministering still</span>
<span class="i0">Unto all souls that suffer, even as now</span>
<span class="i0">I minister to you.</span>
<span class="i20">But what, you ask,</span>
<span class="i0">Of the boy Nello? Beppo died that year—</span>
<span class="i0">God rest his soul!—and the child ’bode with us.</span>
<span class="i0">But when the lad drew nigh to man’s estate—</span>
<span class="i0">Too old for women’s guidance—he was found</span>
<span class="i0">Oftener than elsewhere at the studio</span>
<span class="i0">Of old Fra Alessandro. He became</span>
<span class="i0">A painter, Signor, and men call him great.</span>
<span class="i0">I know not if he is—but you can see</span>
<span class="i0">His pictures yonder in San Spirito.</span>
<span class="i2">You’ve seen them? seen my face there? now you know</span>
<span class="i0">Whence comes the semblance that has puzzled you</span>
<span class="i0">Through all these weeks of languor?</span>
<span class="i36">It may be.</span>
<span class="i0">I am too old to care now, have outlived</span>
<span class="i0">Youth and its petty consciousness. My face</span>
<span class="i0">Is mine no longer. It is God’s alone.</span>
<span class="i0">A Mater Dolorosa?—It is well!</span>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
